<emoji> <type>: <description>

Available types and emojis:

- 🔥 feat: a new feature
- ⚡ fix: a bug fix
- 🎯 chore: changes that do not relate to a fix or feature (e.g., updates)
- ⚙ refactor: refactored code
- 🦋 docs: updates to documentation
- 💎 style: formatting changes
- test: adding or correcting tests
- ✨ perf: performance improvements
- ci: continuous integration
- build: build system or dependencies
- revert: reverts a previous commit

Always keep the description concise and in English.
